# âœ¨TCP-Client_Serverâœ¨

## ðŸ“ŽSubject : Programming for Penetration Testing

### ðŸ“–Backstory
Within our first week of this semester, we were asked to build a simple TCP Client and Server that can communicate with each other. This program is intended to be one of our learning projects in order to explore more on socket programming with python.
I managed to learn python and began to use the available resources that I could get in order to make this program.
